<h1> style="text-align:center;">Centered Heading “In Defense of the Poor Image”</h1>
    
   
    
     <p> style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph. While the topic resonates with me—the aesthetic and the authenticity of the mimeographed punk zine, the scanned quality of video art, the pleasure of video feedback using the weird basic freeze-image graphic generator inexpensive camcorders used to come with—the sensationalistic opening of the essay felt overintent on lauding a collective of “poor images” that might have very different contexts. I mentioned some of these in class but there’s Peggy Ahwesh’s The Color of Love, where she buried a 16mm pornographic film and the action of minerals and water in the soil, maybe earthworms, transformed the three people depicted into grainly, mottled images of a deathly complexion. George Kuchar’s video work is of the same aesthetic of any lay person filming their touristic perambulations but his wit and personality and editing strategies elevate the viewing experience, while its banal home video look remains crucial, and a sonic equivalent is Alvin Lucier’s technique of recording a sound, speech I think, and then replaying it and recording the recording in a space and repeating the process until it naturally becomes first unintelligible and ultimately otherworldly. Is the poor image really a thing, just one thing?
Of course, the point about not insisting on “rich images” is well taken. Oftentimes, poor images were once rich. Not because they have been degraded necessarily, but because they once were (closer to) the state of the art.  One unending project of mine is a documentary of Kurdish wedding music and the young men who serve as professional musicians and their inclination towards overdriven sound, which is significant because it brings a kind of hard rock aesthetic into the space of the Kurdish wedding while also effectively transforming the traditional lute, through distortion and sustain into a traditional shawm used to play dance music in open spaces. I have filmed it since 2004 and have screened it as a finished work numerous times but I see no reason to stop it evolving further. In the early stages, I may have had a fairly fancy camera (a Panasonic dv camera that probably cost $900). As cameras evolved along with the careers of my subjects, I’d still be using a modest digital camera at weddings where there was a many thousand-dollar camera mounted on a swinging crane with the camera man in a seat. This became fairly political in the context of my documentary. I was documenting weddings on the back streets of Kurdish towns in Southeast Turkey and in the anonymous urban sprawl of cities like Mersin and Antalya, to which Kurds had migrated. The atmosphere was spontaneous and gritty. But increasingly, the musicians did not like seeing these weddings featured in the film as the weddings they played as they grew in stature and renown became fancier and fancier. They still performed for working class communities but by the hour wedding halls replaced three day side street weddings, and the spectacle became more glamourous and immaculate, and when documented professionally more high res, well lit, and HD (and cinematographically far less compelling). All of this must be understood against the backdrop of how Kurds are typecast in the Turkish public sphere, by politicians and by the media—poor, uneducated, emotionally unregulated, aggressive, unsophisticated in fashion sensibility, and slow to integrate into contemporary urbane Turkish society. As an ethnographer benefiting from my access to these communities and from immense amounts of hospitality, it is my duty to reciprocate as much as possible, which I have mainly done through facilitating appearances on international stages for some these musicians (SXSW festival in Austin, globalFEST in NYC, DubaiExpo2020, NPR Tiny Desk concert), but often was has been important was acquiring little items that are status symbols (iphone, burberry sunglasses), which I have helped to do. Now when the musicians make their videos, it’s all HD and shot by drones, luxuriating in boats and waterfronts. My documentation has definitely become a poor image, which I would defend, but I suspect it won’t be for a number of years when it becomes valuable again to the musicians—now it is a liability, an obstacle to the erasure of a certain image of the Kurdish wedding as a wild place.
My first encounter with the poor image was as a child. There were three gears of images in my childhood: my father projecting super 8 reels from the silent Lost World; going to the movies, meaning either first run stuff like the Empire Strikes Back and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (the first films I saw in the theater), or screenings at the public library or the Norwegian’s Seamen’s Church (stuff like Where Time Began, The Jungle Book, the Bashki Lord of the Rings, and The Muppet Movie); or, the most frequently accessible, and the pinnacle in my mind of the poor image, television. My parents were very anti-television apart from PBS and refused to own a television but they had lent their landlord a little portable radio on his deathbed in the hospital so he could listen to baseball games so in gratitude he had given them his little black and white TV, which came out once a year when the Wizard of Oz came on. It had two radio shack antennae units that had to be connected to terminals on the back and moved around until the optimum reception was reached. At a certain point at about age 8, I realized I could consult the TV guide for what science fiction and horror movies (the creature feature) were showing on Saturday afternoon and take out the TV and watch them but usually with no assistance in getting the antennas properly positioned, so I watched many films (The Giant Claw, Laserblast, Sssssssss…., The Spider, The Amazing Clossal Man, The Giant Behemoth, X: The Man With X-Ray Eyes, X: The Unknown, The Tourist Trap, Die Monster Die, to name a few) filter through a signal mayhem of static, horizontal lines, and runaway v-hold. The funny thing is I still remember being scared and kept riveted in suspense when I could barely make out what I was looking at or hearing. These days, I am interested in an aesthetic connection to the impenetrability of cheap electronics as conveyers of sound and image. I especially like trying to find ways of making something more than a monotonous screech out of those cassette tapes that used to be a main means for storing computer programs. I remember once making a tone with an oscillator on the Serge Tcherepnin modular synthesizer they had at the music department in college and then transferring it to mag stock and slowing it down on the flatbed editor. What was just a clear, unwavering, steady pitch was revealed to be an enchanting symphony of over- and undertones.

<h1>“As We May Think”</h1>
    
   
  
     <p> style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph. <It is remarkable looking back at this appearing in the 40s but it isn’t surprising, or rather at this point it isn’t absent from contemporary consciousness, that so much of what has been emerging was foreseen. The concerns and desires were present, leading to the articulation of possibilities. H.G. Wells The Shape of Things to Come is striking in the same way, less as a prescient narrative of what is to come than as an inventory of contemporary anxieties and aspirations projected into the future. 
As we discussed in class, the intertwining of artistic (or creative, or humanistic) and military objectives is stunning. I was surprised, when asking the Turkish musician Orhan Gencebay about his role in developing the elektrobağlama, that he opened his long-winded account by pinpointing the moment when a plethora of signal transmission technologies had emerged in the wake of World War 2 and entered into civilian usage. In his book on the vocoder, How to Wreck a Nice Beach, music journalist Dave Tompkins locates its origins in an allied effort, during WWII, to break apart the signals of voice transmissions to make them unrecognizable and reassembling using a giant subterranean apparatus in Algiers to get vital messages circulating without German interception.

<h1>“The Society of the Spectacle”</h1>
    
   
    
     <p> style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph. While Debord’s thoughts are thought-provoking, I do find them unnecessarily aphoristic. He rarely mentions any actual people or events besides for instance Trotsky or the Middle Ages, he keeps it quite abstract. Of course, there are visuals included on some pages that hint at the nature of spectacles. He wants to think in terms of very broad, pervasive phenomena, and it is up to us to apply his thoughts. Reading his writing, some kinds of spectacle that might first jump to mind are Leni Riefenstahl’s Triumph of the Will or stadiums filled with North Koreans wielding colored placards as pixels to create intricate images and typographic tableaus. But clearly, the inferences point to everyday film and television consumption and to the prevalence of aestheticized imagery on billboards or in magazines, and can be applied equally to digital media consumption, and point to how our grounding in reality is informed by the spectacles, which have a runaway agency of their own: “Lived reality is materially invaded by the contemplation of the spectacle while simultaneously absorbing the spectacular order, giving it positive cohesiveness.” I still find that the concept of a spectacle is a bit more varied than the subdomain of the spectacle that has been purposefully created to be consumed as spectacle. The Persian word I associate with spectacle—tamāshā—is used in poetry in the following ways:
Referring to a tavern keeper gazing into a chalice of wine, Hafez writes “vandar ān āi’neh sad guneh tamāshā mikard.” [And in that mirror he beheld a hundred colors]—also perhaps a hundred types of spectacle, since the colors represent qualities, textures, visual entities, and to view, behold, or spectate,” tamāshā kardan,” is literally to “make a spectacle of.” The chalice, akin to the holy grail, is a much sought-after oracular artifact, like a crystal ball. A central theme of the poem is that those searching frantically for this magical cup do not realize that it resides within them. Therefore, the quest is for something interior—the self in search of what the self contains.
And Omar Khayyam, “In sabzeh ke emrūz tamāshāgah māst, tā sabzeh-ye khāk-e mā tamāshāgah-e kīst?”—"This greenery that today is the object of our gaze (or the locus of the spectacle), whose spectacle will it be when it is grass [growing] from our dirt?” A patch of greenery makes for a nice view, but is it a spectacle? Verdancy, gardens, flowing streams are images that recur in Persian poetry and miniature painting and also are ritualized into social life. The Iranian new year, the two weeks from the vernal equinox and the coming of spring, nouruz, is celebrated by preparing a table with grass, garlic, an apple, vinegar, other things (seven in total) that begin with the letter sin, and most businesses shut down during this period, allowing families to reunite and spend time together in natural settings far from crowded urban environments like Tehran and Esfahan. Generally when people get together for relaxation, the optimum setting is a green, outdoor setting, since so much public space is either desert, barren mountains, or congested cities. Baloch male gatherings, marked by music, barbequing, and drinking, take place if possible in a bagh (a garden environment, either in the wild or a walled enclosure with trees and flowers) or by a wadi (in this case meaning a desert rivulet). About a year ago, I attended a music festival in Mosul, Iraq, whose lush setting was a campground (mukhayyam) traditionally used for boy scout retreats but during the period of ISIS/Dahesh rule it was reportedly a training ground for child soldiers who were told that the paradise they would find themselves in upon martyrdom was exactly like this setting. It was striking then that it was also the setting for this nicely mounted outdoor concert celebration of the cultural heritage of Mosul and Ninevah, attended largely by locals who were well dresses and relaxed sitting in rows of chairs arranged on the moist grass enclosed by dense clusters of trees around the perimeter of clearing. 
Demonstrative dancing at weddings along a swath from Southeastern Iran into South Asia is called tamāshā, signifying a show, a spectacle. Attending a dervishes’ ritual (zekr) in Iraqi Kurdistan, I was struck that having after a number of meetings with the shaykh, I had received permission to film the ritual and was directed up to a balcony where I would have the best view of the spectacle it presented, despite the fact that for the participants, gazing so objectively upon the gathering is precluded by a mass subjectivity—the vigorous participation and the attainment of a state of frenzied transport.
